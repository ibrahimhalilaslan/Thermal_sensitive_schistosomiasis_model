Within this repository, three distinct folders—namely, 'previous_estimate_and_new_estimate,' 'S.mansoni,' and 'S.haematobium'—comprise the essential components for our project on the thermal-sensitive mechanistic model of schistosomiasis. 

1. **previous_estimate_and_new_estimate:**
   This folder juxtaposes the prior estimation of the thermal response of schistosomiasis with our newly derived estimate.

2. **S.mansoni:**
   Focused on the Biomphalaria-S. mansoni system, this folder contains both code and data. Notable subfolders include:
   - **mpb_mod_compare:** Calculates thermal response concerning Mean Parasite Burden.
   - **r_not_mod_compare:** Computes the thermal response of schistosomiasis relative to the R_not value.
   - **r_not_response_to_parameters:** Conducts sensitivity analysis of R_not.
   - **ther_sen_par_biom_mansoni:** Encompasses code and data for all thermal-sensitive parameters employed in the model.
   - **water_contact:** Features R code for the thermal response of schistosomiasis, accounting for water contact rate.

3. **S.haematobium:**
   This folder mirrors the structure of 'S.mansoni' but is tailored to the context of S. haematobium.

This organization facilitates a systematic exploration of the R code, experimental data derived from literature, and Global Neglected Tropical Diseases (GNTD) data of schistosomiasis pertinent to our thermal-sensitive mechanistic model project.
